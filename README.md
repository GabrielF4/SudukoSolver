This project has consisted of several steps. The first step was to create a sudoku solver that would load in a 2D array into python.
The next step was to make a GUI for the sudoku solver with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
Thereafter I implemented an API to make the webpage interact with the Python Script.
And finally I rewrote the sudoku solver script to javascript, so everything could be run on loading page on the website without API.

The webpage does not have an url atm but can be loaded on the local machine with the HTML, CSS and JavaScript files in the repository
